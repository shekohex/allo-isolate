//! Allo Isolate
//! Run Multithreaded Rust along with Dart VM (in isolate).
//!
//! Since you can't call into dart from other threads other than the main
//! thread, that holds our rust code from beaing multithreaded, the way that can be done is using Dart [`Isolate`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-isolate/Isolate-class.html)
//! by creating an isolate, send its [`NativePort`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-ffi/NativePort.html) to Rust side, then rust is freely could run and send the result back on that port.
//!
//! Interacting with Dart VM directly isn't that easy, that is why we created
//! that library, it provides [`IntoDart`] trait to convert between Rust data
//! types and Dart Types, and by default it is implemented for all common rust
//! types.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! See [`flutterust`](https://github.com/shekohex/flutterust/tree/master/native/scrap-ffi) and how we used it in the `scrap` package to create a webscrapper using Rust and Flutter.
